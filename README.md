Pizza Sales Data Analysis - SQL Queries-EXCEL-TABLEAU
In this comprehensive pizza sales analysis, we have delved into the data to extract valuable insights regarding the performance of a pizza business. By utilizing SQL queries, we have derived essential key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, which have been visualized and presented through interactive dashboards created in both Tableau and Excel. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the business's financial health, customer behavior, and product performance.

Introduction

This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries. The provided queries cover a range of metrics and trends that can help gain insights into the performance of pizza sales. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about orders, pizzas, their attributes, order dates, and times.

SQL Queries

The following SQL queries are provided in this repository for analyzing pizza sales data:

A. KPIs

Total Revenue: Calculates the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Average Order Value: Calculates the average value of each order.
Total Pizzas Sold: Calculates the total quantity of pizzas sold.
Total Orders: Calculates the total number of orders placed.
Average Pizzas Per Order: Calculates the average number of pizzas in each order.
B. Daily Trend for Total Orders
Generates a report on the daily trend of total orders, providing insights into the sales pattern over different days of the week.

C. Hourly Trend for Orders
Provides an analysis of the hourly distribution of orders to identify peak sales hours.

D. % of Sales by Pizza Category
Calculates the percentage of sales contributed by each pizza category out of the total revenue.

E. % of Sales by Pizza Size
Calculates the percentage of sales contributed by each pizza size out of the total revenue.

F. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
Analyzes the total quantity of pizzas sold for each pizza category in a specific month.

G. Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold
Identifies the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total quantity sold.

H. Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold
Identifies the bottom 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total quantity sold.

Dashboard Creation:

To provide a comprehensive and visually appealing representation of the analysis, we crafted interactive dashboards using both Tableau and Excel. These dashboards showcase the key insights derived from the SQL queries in a user-friendly and easily interpretable manner. The Excel dashboard presents the data in a structured format with charts and graphs for easy comprehension.

Overall, this pizza sales analysis and the accompanying dashboards provide a deep understanding of the business's performance, customer preferences, and market trends. These insights empower decision-makers to make informed choices, optimize operations, and enhance overall profitability.

Conclusion

These SQL queries provide valuable insights into various aspects of pizza sales, including revenue, order patterns, pizza category and size contributions, and top/bottom sellers. By running these queries on a pizza sales dataset, you can gain a deeper understanding of sales performance and make informed business decisions.
